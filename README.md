<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- ![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot] -->

The objective of this project is to build  a meal-planning application.  The goal is to learn and have fun!  I'm building out of personal interest, and to have something for my family to use.  The vision is to have an app that has a recipe book, a scheduling system to plan out meals for the week/month, and an automated shopping list to show what ingredients are needed for the time frame.

We are building this first as a web app.  My personal requirements are to have this accessible on a laptop and on mobile devices.  In my household, that means a Windows, Linux, and Mac laptop, as well as Android and iOS mobile devices!  A web app allows this and keeps the scope reasonable.  We chose Next.js so we have the option to go towards a Progressive Web Application (PWA) later.

The backend is built with FastAPI and SQLite.  The front end is built with Next.js and uses Material UI.  The goal will be to package all of it in a docker container, but for now we're keeping the plates spinning separately.

<!-- WISHLIST -->
## Wishlist

What good is learning without dreaming about what it could do?  Here are some dreams that are out of scope for now, but could be worked on later.
* Do it again, but with React Native to allow native functionality on Android and iOS devices.
* Cost analysis based on ingredients
* Nutrition / Macros analysis based on ingredients
* Scraping websites to automatically generate recipes
* Inventory system to compare against what is already on hand
  * Ability to see expiration dates - trending towards a Home Ec ERP
  * If we're dreaming really big, some computer vision to scan what's in the fridge and pantry.
